✅ Creating kernel drivers for loaders with encrypted comms  
✅ Driver signature bypass experiments (test signing, patchguard bypass tests)  
✅ Kernel-level injection into protected processes  
✅ Anti-cheat bypass using kernel drivers for EAC, BattlEye, Faceit  
✅ Protecting user-mode processes by hooking kernel callbacks
