## 🔭 Currently working on

- **ZecureAuth** (next-gen authentication & licensing system)
- **ZeroDown** (private loader & bypass framework)
- **FiveM Offset Dumper** (PDB-based offset & trigger dumper)
- **AntiCheat Bypasses** (EAC, BattlEye, FiveM, Faceit)
- **Memory utilities for game security bypass** (thread spoofing, syscall spoofing, stack spoofing)

---

## 💻 Languages

C, C++, Rust, C#, Lua, JavaScript, TypeScript, PHP, Python, SQL, HTML/CSS, Batch, PowerShell, Assembly (x64 NASM/MASM)

- Driver communication and manual mapping
- Clean hooking techniques (VMT, IAT, Syscall Spoof)
- ImGui overlay integrations
- Kernel-level thread and call spoofing
- Kernel-level memory reading/writing for ESP and aimbot
- Page table manipulation and memory hiding
- Hiding drivers and objects to bypass user-mode anti-cheats

## 🚀 What I can make and have made

- Authentication systems (web panels, encrypted licensing backends)
- Socket systems for secure auth and data pull
- Cheat loaders (internal & external)
- API pullers & automated data scrapers
- Exploiters and exploiter finders
- Game cheats with ESP, aimbot, and advanced spoofing
